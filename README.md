# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection_Using_ML
This project is focused on building a credit card fraud detection system
using Python.
● Credit card fraud is a serious problem that affects millions of people
worldwide. In this project,there use of machine learning algorithms to
identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
● It starts by loading and exploring the dataset, which contains
information about credit card transactions, including the transaction
amount, time, and whether it was fraudulent or not. Then will
preprocess the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and
scaling the features.
● Next,  will split the dataset into training and testing sets and train a
logistic regression model on the training data. Logistic regression is a
classification algorithm that is commonly used in fraud detection
systems.
● Then evaluate the performance of our model using accuracy
score, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics will
help us understand how well our model is performing in identifying
fraudulent transactions.

Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of fraud detection systems
in preventing credit card fraud and how machine learning algorithms can be
used to build effective fraud detection systems. With further refinement and
optimization, this system can be deployed in real-world scenarios to help
prevent financial losses due to credit card fraud.
